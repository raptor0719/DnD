	<h2>In Service: Forced Suicide</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<div class="text-block">Tyroke's patron is calling him into service. He is to convince a shaman, named Moke, to commit suicide.</div>
	<div class="text-block">This shaman is a part of a small village on the north-western edge of the Deadland's mountain range. There is only about 35 people in the village, with the shaman being an unofficial leader. The town is devoted to worshipping a lizard god that dwells in the caves. They say that he will eventually come to the world to deliver his servants to eternal life as dragons.</div>
	<div class="text-block">Moke is a contemplative man, but is blind in devotion to both his wife and his god. He is not quick to anger, and will almost certainly never fight. Every night he goes into the cave to pray to their lizard god. He is also a healer, and able to cure wounds, diseases, and curses.</div>
	<div class="text-block">While ascending, the adventurers will encounter a Peryton encircling them. If the adventurers have already encountered the Peryton at the Iron Flame tomb, than this one will attack them.</div>
