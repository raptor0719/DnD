	<h2>Iron Flame: The Lost Sword</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<div class="text-block">Cabral has asked the adventurers to go to a tomb to the north, in the Deadlands, to retrieve a sword from the body of one of the founding members of the Iron Flame. He says the tomb is nestled in a rocky outcropping on the border of the autumn-lands and the Deadlands.</div>
	<div class="text-block">Upon descending the stairs and entering a tomb there will be a scroll in a leather bound. On the scroll will be a letter from Lord Thargas saying the following</div>
	<ul>
		<li>He expected the iron flame to come eventually</li>
		<li>He wishes to test the current members</li>
		<li>Trials will be based on the founding tenets of the guild</li>
	</ul>
