	<h2>The Werebear</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	
	<div class="text-block">Ichi Kastan is going to investigate why the town of Autumn's Edge has ceased contact. He was going with the Iron Flame to investigate rumors of a passage into the Underdark in the northern mountains. Another ranger left to check on the town, but has not made contact since.</div>
	
	<div class="text-block">The party will come across the town and find dried blood and eaten corpses scattered across the scape. The adventurers will be able to track a trail of blood that goes away from the town, into a small cave in the side of a large hill.</div>
	
	<div class="text-block">Inside they will find the corpse of the missing ranger, and two remaining villagers (named Joshua and Larq). They say the ranger brought them here for safety, but died just a day ago. They've have been hiding here for awhile. One other villager, Vincent, was not there the night the town was attacked, and they believe he is still out there.</div>
	
	<div class="text-block">Vincent is the creature that attacked the town, and is a werebear. Vincent was the town's huntsman and protector. The adventurers will need to acquire silver weapons to kill him. Or they could attempt to find a healer to lift the curse.</div>
