	<h2>November 14, 2017</h2>

	<div class="text-block">The adenturers exited the mansion to find 2 battlemages and a couple of commoners at the bottom of the town. They approached them and were accused of being apart of the destruction but the battlemages shrugged it off. The adventurers left toward the university with the battlemages as escorts.</div>
	<div class="text-block">On the way the, Torin and Cabral chatted up the battlemages. Their names were Gwin, the senior of the two who Cabral took a liking to, and Delroy, who Torin took a liking to.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The adventurers arrive to the university 2 hours later and go straight to find the archmage. They ask for "Archmage Jagota", but are informed that she is a professor and never has been the archmage. The adventurers feel embarrased, but are directed toward Archmage Nypine's office.</div>
	<div class="text-block">They meet the archmage, who is a gnome, and inform her of the disaster at Riverwatch as well as the demons. Nypine seems to take a liking to them and asks if she can call upon their help in the future. The adventurers reply positively but with the stipulation of them getting paid. Tyroke asks if she has a particular book for a noble, Mr Kastan. Nypine asks him to come back tomorrow to retrieve the book.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The adventurers then head to find Jagota, an enchanter who is a friend of Ignis. They interrupt her class but decide not to press the issue and simply wait for the class to end. Afterward they talk to her, and discover that she seems rather fond of Ignis. She says she is willing to enchant items for the adventurers, but that they must find the ingredients first. The adventurers decide to go find a magic shop instead.</div>
	<div class="text-block">They head to center of the universtiy to find a small magic shop owned by a rather short elf with long blonde hair and a red robe. Aenys purchases a Cloak of Protection and Aenys and Tyroke chip in to purchase a Necklace of Fireballs with 6 beads. Torin inquires about magical weapons or armour and the shopkeeper points them toward an alley where another magic shop is.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The party heads toward the alley and enters a rather shady business. This shop is even smaller than the first and the shopkeeper only has two items: a Staff of Frost and enchanted Plate Mail. The adventurers decline and decide to turn in for the night at a tavern.</div>
	<div class="text-block">They wake up and head back to Nypine to talk to her. Tyroke inquires about the book and retrieves it while Aenys inquires about his sword from which Nypine discovers that it is an ancient sword given to King Tarius I. She seemed okay with the blatant graverobbing under the premise that a demonslayer sword will be useful during these times. She warns of magical seals placed on the tombs by the king's court wizard and seems surprised that they appeared broken, at least until Aenys informed her that the tomb seemingly belonging to the court wizard was empty. Nypine seemed troubled but did not comment.</div>
	<div class="text-block">Finally, Torin inquired about the barrels of explosive powder they had found. Again, Nypine was surprised to learn that they had come into contact with the substance. She told him that such a substance has been around for awhile, and that the dwarves had mostly been trying to sell it to various leaders around the world, but other than that it was kept under wraps.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The adventurers left the archmage to meet Cabral, and informed them of a mission to head north toward the Deadlands and retrieve the sword of one of the founding members of the Iron Flame. They decide to head back to Durok City to meet Ignis and Mr. Kastan.</div>
	<div class="text-block">Torin and Aenys meet Ignis to retrieve Aenys' sword who informs them of a group of Iron Flame that went north with Ichi Kastan to hunt something "big", while Tyroke goes to talk to Mr. Kastan. Tyroke delivers the book to Mr. Kastan, who informs Tyroke of an informant in the Qin region, who studies demons and other things.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The adventurers decide to head north to meet up with the other Iron Flame members and Ichi, and also to retrieve the sword from the tomb.</div>
