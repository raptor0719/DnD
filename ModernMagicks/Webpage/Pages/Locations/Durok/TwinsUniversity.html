	<h2>Twins University</h2>
	<div class="text-block">A large university on the western shore of the Bay of Fingers. Founded by Nypine and Kirro.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The Twins University, despite people thinking it was named after the sibling kingdoms Durok and Tarok, is actually named after it’s twin towers: The Tower of Knowledge and the Tower of Magic. It is now the centre of magic and study in the entire world.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The university is a large campus, with 2 large towers, one on the north wall and one on the south wall. The entire campus has a large cobblestone wall with archways for entrance ways. The university is almost a small city, with plenty of living quarters, inns, and shops in the center, as well as it’s own port.</div>
	<div class="text-block">On the northern end is The Court of Knowledge with its center piece, The Tower of Knowledge. Around the tower is being built a large library to hold the thousands of books that the university has accumulated over the years. In this court also lies the botanical gardens and all of the classrooms. Everything from blacksmithing to extra-plana studies is taught here.</div>
	<div class="text-block">On the southern end is The Court of Magic with its center piece, The Tower of Magic. The Court of Magic represents the practical side of The Court of Knowledge. Basically the entire grounds is dedicated to dueling arenas, alchemical labs, forges, and everything else to practice the knowledge one has learned.</div>
	<div class="text-block">On the eastern side is the port. Although small compared to Durok City's port and tiny compared to Tarok City's port, this still serves it purpose. Most of the trade that comes in here is supplies for the university, but there are also trade caravans that travel out of here to many of the local towns.</div>
	<div class="text-block">The center of the city is a large marketplace and commonman quarter. There are many non-university people that live here, although many of them could be employed as manual laborers or in tradeskills. The rest are likely sailors or those that work closely with the port.</div>
