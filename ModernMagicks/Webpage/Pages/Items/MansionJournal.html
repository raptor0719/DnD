	<h2>Mansion Journal</h2>
	<div class="text-block">Found in the mansion that looks over Riverwatch on the desk in the upstairs library. The book was found open to the section marked "Suffering", and was specifically at a page detailing a ritual.</div>

	<div>The table of contents included the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Deception</li>
			<li>Suffering</li>
			<li>Flame</li>
			<li>Greed</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Deception</h2>
		<div>This section is rather bare and does not contain much information. It speaks of an enigmatic entity that, apparently, enjoys trickery and the shadows. It's followers follow in suit, and generally blend extremely well into society. It does speak of a monk near the Land of Always Autumn who, apparently, follows this entity openly, although is a hermit. This hermit can be found wandering the south-western edge of the autumn-lands near the Karabi Desert.
		</div>
		<div>The writer does specifically say how he doesn't believe this entity is particularly evil, in the sense that it does not wish to see it's followers, or others, harmed bodily. Mentally, though, could be another story. The write does NOT think this entity is widely worshipped considering it's own nature.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Suffering</h2>
		<div>This section is by far the biggest and most well documented section. It is marked "Suffering" and depicts a female wrapped with off-white cloth. Her eyes are covered by a cloth as well, and blood spots exist where her eyes are, as if she has had them gouged out. Her symbol is a large circle with seven smaller circles evenly distributed along the edge. In the center is a skull with 3 rods pierced through it.
		</div>
		<div>The writer names this demon as "Lillith, Lord of Suffering". She is a demon lord who has only recently started to show herself. The writer documents that he has found no accounts of this demon existing before about 100 years ago. Since then her number of followers has increased relatively fast, and they have also grown more brazen. Recently, they have begun commiting minor crimes, such as theft and robbery, to even things as seriously as murder. The writer even talks of a personal account of a fishing village on the north east coast of the western continent being completely wiped of all life from cultists. The individual WAS able to draw a symbol that closely resembled the symbol of Lillith seen elsewhere, but the validity of the claim is unconfirmed.
		</div>
		<div>Next, a ritual is described in some detail. The ritualist must carve the symbol of Lillith into stone and it must be deep enough and wide enough to "contain the first section on one's finger". Next, the ritualist should obtain a "mound" of flesh as well as 7 candles. The more "pure of essence" the flesh is, the more favor Lillith will have of the ritualist. The flesh should be placed in the center of the circle on top of the skull, while the candles should be placed, and lit, along the circle, equidistant from eachother. He/She must then fill the symbol with warm blood and ask Lillith for their request. According to accounts, the ritualist must be under intense pain, or the ritual will be unsuccessfull. Some accounts, according to the writer, say that intense emotional pain works as well as physical pain, but that appears to be speculation.
		</div>
		<div>Despite multiple detailed descriptions of this ritual, the writer says he has found no accounts of the aftermath or outcomes of the ritual. Some books and journals have described the ritual as necromantic, to bring back loved ones from the dead. The writer says that, he himself was given such a book from an individual who claimed to follow Lillith. Other accounts claim it is simply to ask for wishes, or for power. But these appear to just be semantic spins on the ritual to coax those who do not know what is truelly happening, the writer speculates.
		</div>
		<div>The writer talks about the concentration of the followers of Lillith. They are mostly concentrated in Durok, specifically more uninhabited areas or rural areas specifically north of the Deadlands. They have some presence near cities, but because of the nature of their practices, Durok outlaws them through the anti-necromancy laws.
		</div>
		<div>The writer definitely believes that Lillith is an extremely dangerous demon. She thrives off of the suffering of the living, and only wishes to see the world in pain. He believes that under no circumstance does he believe following and serving this particular demon lord could have a positive impact on oneself.
		</div>

		<h2>Flame</h2>
		<div>This is section that depicts what looks like a molten dwarf that looks mostly of rock and lava. The writer indicates that his followers practice in the northern mountains of Farrala near a holy place for the Farralan people. It particularly gives a clue to getting to this secret worship area: "May those who bear the fruit of fire pass safely into his haven." The writer does not know what "the fruit of fire" refers to, but speculates that holding it will provide some sort of fire protection. 
		</div>
		<div>The journal goes on to explain that the loose followers he has talked to believe he is some sort of protector of the mountains and guardian from the elemental planes. Scholars, in contrast, believe it is this entity that caused the eruption of the mountain range 1 thousand years ago, and through it, the formation of the Farralan Kingdom. 
		</div>
		<div>This writer seems to think that this elemental does not wish to cause harm on it's own, but is selfish, careless, and brazen, and that others will often be harmed because of this. Putting this aside, apparently strict followers of this entity will be granted knowledge of treasure and metalworking, as well enchantments of fire, and passage into the elemental planes.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Greed</h2>
		<div>This section is relatively fleshed out and it depicts a hulking mummified man that appears to be much larger than average size both in height, and stature. His face and body are wrapped, but is wearing royal garments. His eyes gleam bright, and he stands amongst a treasure hoard of gold and jewels.
		</div>
		<div>The writer identifies this entity as "King Juh'shah", an ancient king who ruled the ancient Minerrian Empire that is now the vast desert known as the Oasis. He is often casually called for blessings from gamblers or investors, or others who wish to turn monetary events in their favor. He does also have more fervent followers, who practice openly. 
		</div>
		<div>Despite the active followers, the writer says there are no records of this entity communicating with it's followers or anyone else. Many of the most passionate spend their time trying to find King Juh'shah's burial or living quarters. Most of these search parties are noble followers of King Juh'shah who have the money to pay for excavation teams, as well as interested scholars, to assist in the search.
		</div>
		<div>The writer admits he does not know how an ancient king came to be worshipped in this capacity, but that perhaps some of the more virulent followers could assist. The writer specifically mentions a "Baron Vaseem", who is a noble in the Farralan empire, that has spent much of his time and money excavating the Minerrian Empire. THe writer also mentions that a historical scholar at the university named "Yorin" may be able to help as well.
