	<h1>Mansion Journal</h1>
	<div>Found in the mansion that looks over Riverwatch on the desk in the upstairs library.</div>

	<div>The table of contents included the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Deception</li>
			<li>Suffering</li>
			<li>Flame</li>
			<li>Greed</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

		<h2>Deception</h2>
		<div>This section is rather bare and does not contain much information. It speaks of an enigmatic entity that, apparently, enjoys trickery and the shadows. It's followers follow in suit, and generally blend extremely well into society. It does speak of a monk near the Land of Always Autumn who, apparently, follows this entity openly, although is a hermit. This hermit can be found wandering the south-western edge of the autumn-lands near the Karabi Desert.
		</div>
		<div>The writer does specifically say how he doesn't believe this entity is particularly evil, in the sense that it does not wish to see it's followers, or others, harmed bodily. Mentally, though, could be another story. The write does NOT think this entity is widely worshipped considering it's own nature.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Suffering</h2>
		<div>This section is by far the biggest and most well documented section. </div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Flame</h2>
		<div>This is section that depicts what looks like a molten dwarf that looks mostly of rock and lava. The writer indicates that his followers practice in the northern mountains of Farrala near a holy place for the Farralan people. It particularly gives a clue to getting to this secret worship area: "May those who bear the fruit of fire pass safely into his haven." The writer does not know what "the fruit of fire" refers to, but speculates that holding it will provide some sort of fire protection. 
		</div>
		<div>The journal goes on to explain that the loose followers he has talked to believe he is some sort of protector of the mountains and guardian from the elemental planes. Scholars, in contrast, believe it is this entity that caused the eruption of the mountain range 1 thousand years ago, and through it, the formation of the Farralan Kingdom. 
		</div>
		<div>This writer seems to think that this elemental does not wish to cause harm on it's own, but is selfish, careless, and brazen, and that others will often be harmed because of this. Putting this aside, apparently strict followers of this entity will be granted knowledge of treasure and metalworking, as well enchantments of fire, and passage into the elemental planes. No documented case of any of this exists though, according to the writer.
		</div>

	<div>Formula
		<h2>Greed</h2>
		<div>This section is relatively fleshed out and it depicts a hulking mummified man that appears to be much larger than average size both in height, and stature. His face and body are wrapped, but is wearing royal garments. His eyes gleam bright, and he stands amongst a treasure hoard of gold and jewels.
		</div>
		<div>The writer identifies this entity as "King Juh'shah", an ancient king who ruled the ancient Minerrian Empire that is now the vast desert known as the Oasis. He is often casually called for blessings from gamblers or investors, or others who wish to turn monetary events in their favor. He does also have more fervent followers, who practice openly. 
		</div>
		<div>Despite the active followers, the writer says there are no records of this entity communicating with it's followers or anyone else. Many of the most passionate spend their time trying to find King Juh'shah's burial or living quarters. Most of these search parties are noble followers of King Juh'shah who have the money to pay for excavation teams, as well as interested scholars, to assist in the search.
		</div>
		<div>The writer admits he does not know how an ancient king came to be worshipped in this capacity, but that perhaps some of the more virulent followers could assist. The writer specifically mentions a "Baron Vaseem", who is a noble in the Farralan empire, that has spent much of his time and money excavating the Minerrian Empire. THe writer also mentions that a historical scholar at the university named "Yorin" may be able to help as well.
